Humans are primates, great apes in fact but I don’t know all how great we are as a species. Chimpanzees share 98.8% of there DNA with humans, our closest living relative, but as I see it every living creature is in some way our relative even trees. Only 800 million years ago animal cells started appearing on earth comprised of mainly the same parts and following the same functions as plant cells. Requiring oxygen, solar energy, minerals, nutrients and water. This tree(Juniperus osteosperma)was surviving in only inches of soil, in an area of extreme heat and drought. I think our culture, our society has put itself above all living creatures, creating needs purely to support destructive economic practices. This tree doesn’t require an Apple Watch, it doesn’t stream its favorite shows, or have a microwave oven, pay health insurance or drink grande iced caramel macchiatos. It is just a tree but you rarely see geese riding jet skis or wearing designer clothing either. I think if we all want breathable air and drinkable water we all need to learn how to live with less🌏

Not alot of biodegradable packaging for on the go food these days, that’s why I stick with my melon rinds, apple cores, peach pits and banana peals. Also most melons contain around 90% water, talk about hydration. Lets keep plastic water bottles off the trail or better yet off the planet #melonvibes

Barefoot hiking 𓂻 ☀︎︎

Thank you for putting up with me through Utah, a topographic playground. 𓅰 

I choose to only spend my time in places I don’t have to wear shoes. Barefoot lifestyle 𓀡 . Always listen to The natural life stylist Podcast when we’re traveling on the road

⛈. After leaving Colorado and getting stuck in a dust storm, We camped in Zion for 3 nights, watching the lightning and listening to the thunder from our tent. It’s really nice to go on 100° hike every day and feel the cold come in at night, waiting for the rain. 𓆏 Also- everyone who walked by could not figure out how I climbed all these rocks . . 

⛰ Zion is proof that mankind can ruin anything even in an effort to preserve it. Beautiful park just with an unfortunate infestation of human beings. 𓆈

It’s a lot easier walking up river holding someone’s hand than walking alone.☀︎︎

First time out to the Great Sand Dunes, I’ve never set foot in a terrain like this, let alone surf down hills of sand, or tasted sand, I got to taste a lot of sand. 𓆈

🦂 Downsizing our life to fit into this itty bitty van was the best decision we’ve ever made. With the limited space we wanted to take advantage of every inch, while also keeping everything minimalist. Definitely felt inspired by a lot of other van-lifers on Youtube but we came up with a completely original layout. Barely spent anything on the conversation and couldn’t be happier with the outcome.  Van tour coming soon! Sacrificing space to wake up in nature everyday has been no sacrifice at all. 𓆙 Cross country road trip... 

That picnic basket has taken us to some beautiful spots

Garden on wheels! New Van means new adventures 🏔🌿

Never got around to posting these! I’d die just to watch all of our memories on repeat, never loved anyone as much as this girl💕

This was a fun one! I wanna give them little bodies with blood spraying from there necks, a lot of gore, maybe an axe or a chainsaw, generic Itchy and Scratchy stuff:)

BMO has gotta be my favorite character, also a little Peppermint Butler thrown in there!

The f*cking craziest out of all of Chuck’s books on my shelf, I can’t fathom how he must have written this one! I’d love to preach all of the insane twists and turns but all I can say is that I’ll never forget the name Rant Casey. Or Green Taylor Simms. Me and my fiancé read this one out loud together and boy oh boy I can’t believe some of the stuff coming out of our mouths Chuck Palahniuk.

Reading is different than any other consumption of media, it takes more effort that staring at a screen half alive, it allows you to use your brain rather than melt it, and there is no author more stimulation to me than Chuck Palahniuk 

I’ve taken Chuck’s books on hundred mile treks through the AT and there’s nothing worse than losing my page! I’m not comfortable putting some generic marker in between such powerful pages so I decided to print my own Chuck Palahniuk

When I pondered whether I should do a luci stamp all I could hear in the deep recesses of my mind was “do it” #disenchantment

Loved the new joker. Wanted to make a minimal stamp of the new prince of crime

Charta Malum. Our mistake has been placing our faith in government rather than put our efforts into sustainable farming. Our forests paved over for shopping malls opposed to everyone living amongst nature and living off of the land rather than pillaging it.

A few more. Just wanna say I’m a really big fan @artofmm. It might sound silly to say but the first time I picked up hellboy I was eight and it had a big impact on me. Thank you for creating such an intricate character

I will actually attribute all of my skill in painting to dissecting the works of @artofmm I have never attended any schooling for art, but because of my love of comics I never needed a second in a classroom

Just dug up some of my old watercolors.

Me and the coolest kid I know, my nephew. BFF,s since the day he was born.

Ruins of a paper mill getting pulled into a creek years after a massacre by union solders. Cool spot to chill.

My biggest fear is that one day I’ll wake up and it will have all been a dream, because that is what every second has felt like since the moment we found each other. Till death do us part or until I wake up, I’m so happy the answer was yes.

Little romantic getaway to the mountains

Wow, the West coastline along Highway one sported some of the most impressive rock formations

The highlight of Los Angels was definitely the street art, now I know what people mean when they say LA sucks

I’ve hiked hundreds of miles on the AT but hiking in Colorado seemed like my ship crashed on a whole other planet

It’s been an incredible year, by far the best of my life. Ive been to so many beautiful places, had so many amazing experiences and all with the best side kick in the world!
